Objective:
Implement BFS and DFS to solve a maze.
Problem
Statement: Given a grid-based maze where 0 represents walls and 1 represents
walkable paths, find the shortest path from a start cell to an end cell.
Tasks:
Use BFS to find the shortest path.
Use DFS to explore all possible paths and report one valid path (not necessarily the
shortest).
Compare the number of nodes explored by BFS and DFS
