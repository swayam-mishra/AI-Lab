# **Uniform Cost Search for Optimal Path**
**Objective**
- Implement Uniform Cost Search for a weighted graph
- PS: Given a weighted graph (e.g. a transporattion network with travel costs) find the minimum cost past between two nodes

**Tasks**
- Represent the graph in adjacency list
- Implement Uniform Cost Search to  find the optimal path
- Cpmpare it with BFS
