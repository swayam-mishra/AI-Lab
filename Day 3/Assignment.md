## **Route Finder Using Bi-Directional BFS/DFS**

**Objective**: Use Bi-directional BFS/DFS to solve a navigation problem.

**Problem Statement**: Represent a city map as a graph where intersections are nodes and roads are edges. Find the shortest path between two locations.

**Tasks**:
Implement Bidirectional BFS to minimize the number of nodes explored.
Compare the performance of Bi-directional BFS with standard BFS and DFS.
Visualize the search process (e.g., using a library like networkx in Python).
